Throughout the entire project, all team members actively communicated and kept up to date 
with the project via Microsoft Teams and our occasional online meetings. 

Alongside this, in an attempt to distribute the work evenly, individuals who
were assigned a larger portion for the first deliverable were given a lighter
workload for deliverable 2 and vice versa.
