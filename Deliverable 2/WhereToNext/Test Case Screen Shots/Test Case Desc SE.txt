To test our software the minimium unit required for our software to function is the user profile containing user information.
Here there are six test cases in this particular order: a successful creation of a new user (as an object), a test case for both
valid and invalid ages when registering, a test case for both valid and invalid names when registering, and a failed test case for 
passwords when registering. A single user profile requires three things: a valid name, a valid password, and a valid age.
An age is considred valid if the user's age is within 15 to 109 years of life (14 < X < 110, where X is the user age). A [user]name
is valid if both inputted names are no greater than 20 characters in length (the underscore is added by the system and not by the user
so 41 characters maximium). Finally a password is considered valid if the length of the password is either between or exactly 6 and 12 
characters long, complexity is not required! (6 <= X <= 12, where X is the number of characters in the password). Should a user successfully
meet all criteria they will become registered as a user and added to the data base [implmentation pending], but should a user fail at any 
stage of the criteria then they will be prompted to correct their error. This does not extend to user age verification as a failiure for
that component results in a critical failiure as a way to discourage underaged and joke accounts from becoming created.
