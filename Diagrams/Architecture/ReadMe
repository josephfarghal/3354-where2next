A very basic and barebone model of the architecture is uploaded at the moment. I will improve on it tomorrow.

Details to add:
  Specifc Requests and Respond that occur between layers
  Layer Details/Components
  Layer Functions (Request and Responds) (Validate All Functional Requirements are met)

Reference 6.8 and 6.9 of Ch6 Slides.
