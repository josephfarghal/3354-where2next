Layer Specifics

  Where2Next User Interface
    -Provides the graphical interface to user (Renders data and interface to user)
    -Initiates all requests for data and operations via the users actions

  Where2Next Logic/Functional Layer
    -Receives inputs from the User Interface and maps user interaction to corresponding logic operations/functions
    -Carries out operations and requests necessary data from Where2Next DataBase

  Where2Next Database
    -Houses all data specific to Where2Next such as tags and user data (Account Information, History, Reveiws, Activites, Events)
    -Actual location and event details are not stored here as this information can easily be retreived from Google Maps and we want 
     to avoid accessive and redundant memory usage.
          -Goal here is restrict stored data only to that which is necessary and unique to Where2Next

Google Maps Interface:
    -We do not have access to the internals to Google Maps, so Where2Next must use it as if it were a ordinary end user.
    -Google Maps will provide end details such as address, closing time, and directions
    -The data from Google Map can be processed however necessary and presented via the Where2Next Interface rather than the Google Maps Interface
