The project will be employing the spiral model. 
Because “where2meet” has multiple features and heavily relies on user interaction, it is necessary to come up with multiple prototypes before slowly perfecting the product. 
The spiral model offers the perfect division for this. 
We chose the spiral model over the prototyping evolutionary model because our product deals with a lot of data. 
As developers, we have a responsibility to protect our user’s privacy, hence with each prototype created, risk must be analyzed to ensure data is not vulnerable. 
The spiral model allows developers to move cyclically, repeating some steps to ensure we are able to meet requirements while developing a secure product that our customer is comfortable using. 
The cycle of determining objectives and constraints before evaluating and resolving risk in order to develop product before planning the next phase offers an organic feel to the development process. 
If we are to use the spiral model in conjunction of beta testing, the product should be able to satisfy user needs in a secure manner.
