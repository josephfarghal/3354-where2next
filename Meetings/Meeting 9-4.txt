- a detailed description of your motivation (why you chose to do this particular project), where you expect your design to be used in real life. 
- the list of tasks delegated to each member: the task delegation should be distributing what to do from start to completion of the project to each member of your group. It does not have to be too detailed. One sentence for each member is sufficient.

Sample Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PJ3rs7KTtf1aGK4xYeR-eWfUw_sXaTv1RG5SNSQ_FrQ/edit?usp=sharing

Meeting Three: 10/6 
1. Model we liked? 
a. Spiral
2. MVC vs Layered Architecture 
- Lennon: Repository
o Most familiar 
o Can easily keep up with changes 
- Joseph & Dara & Lennon & Manh: Layered 
o Build upon google maps already 
o Practical and intuitive to some extent 
o We’re leaning more towards this because we’re going to be building on an existing application 
o Each layer has a clear role
o Has access to below layers 
o Easier to store information
* Information can be stored in a more organized manner vs MVC where data is just all together 
- Charlie & Ariel & Nuria: MVC 
o Divides system clearly into Model, View, and Controller
* This is practical if the user has to change data behind the scenes  
* UI + user interaction + data 
* Clear separation of components of application 
* Data and Logic are clearly divided and represented 
* Monitors other layers




Lennons interpretation of the discussion of architecture

Joseph wants layered 
- it would integrate with google maps
- Best used when adding new to old systems 

Arial 
- Wanted layered and mvc
- Mvc 
- Layered works well because we are adding upon google maps 

Charlie
- Wanted mvc because it is more intuitive 

Nuria
- Likes mvc it has a clear separation of tasks
