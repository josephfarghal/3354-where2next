Similar applications to our Where2Next software include Google Maps and Yelp. Since Where2Next is an extension 
of Google Maps, it works with it. Where2Next is different from Google Maps and Yelp specifically because of its 
tagging system and user history tracking. Our tagging system is a feature to help businesses expose their products 
or services. Some tag examples include “birthday,” “relaxing,” or “gluten-free.” Additionally, Where2Next is keeping 
the user’s history and ratings to help find more places similar to what they enjoy.
